Subject: I will be your mentor for bug triage for one month :-)

Hi,

Congratulations! You reached the second step of the process to become a
core developer, you got the bug triage permission!

https://github.com/vstinner/misc/blob/master/cpython/pep-core_dev_process.rst#step-2-bug-triage-permission

The first obvious change for you is that you are now allowed to close a bug on bugs.python.org. But getting the bug triage permission first means additional responsibilities. For example, if you close a bug that should not be closed, we "loose" information since closed bugs are hidden from the homepage and ignored (by default) in the search results.


As any Python contributor, you have to respect the Python Code of Conduct (CoC):

http://cpython-core-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_of_conduct.html

You are also expected to show a good example of being kind and respectful.


If you want to learn more about the CPython workflow, you can find
information at:

https://devguide.python.org/
http://cpython-core-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

You can ask questions on the core-mentorship or the python-dev mailing
lists, the #python-dev IRC channel on Freenode, or you can ask me
directly (that's part of my mentor role).

I would prefer that you ask me to double check a bug before
closing it. You can ping me on the bug directly, or send me an
email. I expect that after a few closed bugs, you will be
quickly autonomous.

Anyway, don't hesitate to come to me for any question. And again,
congratulations!

Victor, your mentor for one month ;-)
