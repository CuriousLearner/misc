Subject: I will be your mentor for core dev during one month :-)

Hi,

Congratulations! You reached the last step of the process to become a
core developer, you have been promoted as a core developer!

https://github.com/vstinner/misc/blob/master/cpython/pep-core_dev_process.rst#step-4-core-developer

The first obvious change for you is that you are now allowed to merge
a pull request on the CPython project. But being a core developer is
first additional responsibilities. Once you merge a pull request, you
becomes the maintainer of the change, and you are expected to fix any
potential regression.

As any Python contributor, you have to respect the Python Code of Conduct (CoC):

http://cpython-core-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_of_conduct.html

You are also expected to show the good example of being kind and respectul.

Since core developers are all volunteers, we cannot request you to
triage bug and review pull requests, but it is a good practice.

If you want to learn more about the CPython workflow, you can find
information at:

https://devguide.python.org/
http://cpython-core-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

You can ask questions on python-committers, mailing list restricted to
core developers but public, core-mentorship, the python-dev mailing
listo, the #python-dev IRC channel on Freenode, or you can ask me
directly (that's part of my mentor role).

I would prefer that you ask me to double check a pull request before
you merge it. You can ping me on the pull request, or send me an
email. I expect that after a few merged pull requests, you will be
quickly autonomous.

Anyway, don't hesitate to come to me for any question. And again,
congratulations!

Victor, your mentor for one month ;-)
